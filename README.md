## Bio

I search for sustainable business models for digital health solutions as the founder of diabetes startup [Sensotrend](/Sensotrend), advance interoperability between healthcare IT systems as the FHIR ambassador of [HL7 Finland](https://hl7.fi), advocate for patientsâ€™ access to high quality treatment as the chair of the [Regional Network of Diabetes Associations in Pirkanmaa](/pirkanmaandiabetes), and seek to advance the adoption of new technologies for diabetes treatment as the vice chairman of the Diabetes Unit of [Sailab - MedTech Finland](https://www.sailab.fi/). I live with type 1 diabetes and hold a M.Sc. in computer science.

Sensotrend makes life with diabetes easier by visualizing data and deriving actionable insights from dozens of medical devices and wellness trackers and facilitating sharing the information with healthcare professionals and peers. Sensotrend is a key contributor in the [HL7 International Patient Access specification](HL7/fhir-ipa), a winner of the [Fair Health Data Challenge](https://www.sitra.fi/en/projects/the-fair-health-data-challenge/) by the Finnish innovation fund Sitra and a founding member of the [MyData Global](https://mydata.org/) organization
